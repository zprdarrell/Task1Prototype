                        <li>Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many businesses will also accept euros and yen. Several banks facilitate currency exchange, and many businesses accept major credit cards. </li>
                        <li>Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English. Very little English is spoken in rural areas, especially by the older residents.</li>
